Mod Name: adaptogen

The purpose of this mod is to introduce a new PHP cast type named `(adapt)` that can trigger scheduled command execution through an external service and return a typed result directly in user code. The headline description is: "Add an Adaptogen cast operator that turns a class reference into a live automation call and inferred PHP value." In this design, `(adapt) AdaptogenClass1::class` acts like a first-class language feature, not a helper function, so it feels native in the same way `(string)` or `(bool)` does.

At a high level, the cast reads the target class, calls static `cron()` and `command()` methods, and sends those values as `cron` and `command` in a POST request to port `245`. The response body is then interpreted into a concrete PHP value using ordered inference: integer first (including `0`/`1` to boolean), then float, then JSON object/array to decoded array, then case-insensitive string booleans like `true`/`False`, and finally plain string fallback. This keeps the runtime behavior deterministic while still allowing flexible command outputs.

This could work for three strong reasons. First, the syntax is concise and memorable, which makes scheduled command orchestration easy to adopt in application code. Second, centralizing execution through the existing port-245 service enables cache reuse and consistent execution policy instead of per-project shell glue. Third, the explicit inference order gives predictable, ergonomic return values so calling code can often avoid repetitive parsing boilerplate.

This might not work for three practical reasons. First, adding a new cast type requires parser, scanner, compiler, and VM changes in Zend, so compatibility and maintenance burden are higher than a userland library approach. Second, relying on a local HTTP service introduces an operational dependency that can fail at runtime (service down, networking issues, stale cache behavior). Third, heuristic type inference can misclassify ambiguous outputs in edge cases, which may surprise callers unless strict output conventions are enforced.
